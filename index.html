    <h1>Hello my name is Vincent.</h1>
    <h2>I am a sophomore at SITHS.</h2>
    <p>
      I am writing this short paragaph for my Advanced APSCP About Me project.
      It is my first introduction to using HTML. It is quite interesting and I
      am vaguely getting the basics of it. I like quite a few things such as
      playing games, listening to music, and consuming content. I like precision
      platformers such as Geometry Dash and Celeste.
